# Stock Portfolio Tracker

This is a React frontend for a finance planning application. It connects to a separate
[API Repo](https://github.com/jtclayt/finance_planner_api).


## Planned features:
- View total stock holding information based on transactions
- View overall portfolio information based on stocks, graph and summary
- Connect to live stock data for up to date returns
- Set up a desired porfolio distribution that will allow a user to put in
a total amount they would like to invest which will show what amount they need
to buy in each stock to meet distribution
- Create a budget, keeping track of monthly income and expenses
- Track net worth with monthly reports and view graph of completed reports


## Other Info
- This app uses the TD Ameritrade Developer API (https://developer.tdameritrade.com/)


### Other other stuff
- I update this only intermittenly.
- There is no logical order to what I work on. I'm just here to have fun.
